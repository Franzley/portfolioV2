        The aim of my team was to design a movie discovery website with watch list functionality where the user can add or delete
        movies from their watch lists. Other features included the ability to search for movies which are fetched from an API. 
        The web application also consisted of sign up and login pages. User accounts were managed through Firebase and database with Firestore.
